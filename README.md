## Dijkstra's Algorithm To Find Shortest Distance Between Two Nodes

##### The algorithm was implemented using a weighted graph, you can set your own nodes and edges

##### First make sure you compile the code; to do that,

```
javac DisplayGraph.java
```

##### After compiling, run the code, as:

```
java DisplayGraph
```
