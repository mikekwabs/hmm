## Dijkstra's Algorithm To Find Shortest Distance Between Two Nodes

##### The algorithm was implemented using a weighted graph, you can set your own nodes and edges

##### First make sure you compile the code; to do that,

```
cd Dijkstra
javac DisplayGraph.java
```

##### After compiling, run the code, as:

```
java DisplayGraph
```

## Vogel's Approximation Method for Solving Transporation Problem

##### To use the vogel approximation method, you will need to enter an array of supply, demand, and the cost the cost should be enter in a 2-D array. The algorithm calculates the total cost to reach a destination taking the supply and demand into consideration.

```
cd VogelApproximation
javac VogelApproximation.java
```

#### And;

```
java VogelApproximation
```
